There will be a weekly reading assignment of up to about 80 pages and requiring about four hours. The reading assignments will come from several sources. Readings are listed by [session](#Readings_by_Session) below. The texts with an abbreviation preceeding the citation are recommended for purchase and are referenced in the table using their abbreviation. Additional texts and articles are referenced in the table by author and year. Not all sessions will have additional readings.

In most cases the readings are one or a few chapters extracted from a long monograph. Even well written chapters taken out of their context will lose some clarity and some of their meaning, and, for example, it would be much better to read Medawar's _Advice to a Young Scientist_ straight through rather than in bits and pieces as is indicated in this syllabus. Because the reading selections come from a wide range of sources you will often notice a significant and sometimes jarring difference in style and perspective from one piece to the next. This can make the articles a good deal harder to assimilate on first reading than they would be if we could take the time to read the full volume from which they are taken.

In the remainder of the semester the participants will have a chance to give a short oral report of their thesis research (or of a paper they find interesting) to a critical but sympathetic audience, their classmates.  
Each class member will give the presenter a written evaluation.

Our goal in these short seminars is to emphasize the beginning and the end  
parts of the research story, while largely omitting the technical details  
of the middle (which are, of course, crucially important but you deal with that at length elsewhere).  
This seminar will have been successful if the participants find that they are even slightly more comfortable writing and talking about the goals,  
the logical structure and the interpretation of their research.  
Are the goals, as you write them down now, any different than at the time of the first class, Question 1(a)?
